## Scope of Variables in JavaScript :-
In JavaScript, scope is the context that determines where variables can be accessed, helping write cleaner and error-free code.
// Declaring a global variable
let x = 10;

function func() {
    
    // Declaring a local variable
    let y = 20;

    // Accessing Local and Global
    // variables
    console.log(x,",", y);
}

func();

output:-
10,20

** Global and Local Scope:-
// Global Scope 
let x=10;

function f1(){
//local scope 
let y=20;
console.log("Global scope",x);
console.log("local scope",y);
}
f1();

output:
10 
20

1) Global Scope
A global variable refers to a variable that is declared outside any function or block, so it can be used anywhere in the program, both inside functions and in the main code.
// Global Variable accessed from within a function 
const x = 10;

function fun1() {
    console.log(x);
}

fun1();

output:-
10

Explanation: 
In the program, the variables outside the function and now we can access those variables from anywhere in the JavaScript program.

2) Local Scope/function scope:-
A local variable is a variable declared inside a function, making it accessible only within that function. It cannot be used outside the function.
Functions and Objects are also variables in JavaScript.
function fun2(){
    
    // This variable is local to fun2() and 
    // cannot be accessed outuside this function
    let x = 10;
    console.log(x);
}

fun2();

output :-
10
Explanation: 
In the Program, the code defines a function fun2 with a local variable x, which is accessible only inside the function, and prints its value when the function is called.

**Block and Lexical Scope:-
3) Block Scope
In JavaScript, block scope refers to variables declared with let or const inside a { } block. 
These variables are accessible only within that block and not outside it.
